# Model failover
\nOpenKrab handles failures in two stages:

1. **Auth profile rotation** within the current provider.
2. **Model fallback** to the next model in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.

This doc explains the runtime rules and the data that backs them.

## Auth storage (keys + OAuth)
\nOpenKrab uses **auth profiles** for both API keys and OAuth tokens.

- Secrets live in `~/.openkrab/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` (legacy: `~/.openkrab/agent/auth-profiles.json`).
- Config `auth.profiles` / `auth.order` are **metadata + routing only** (no secrets).
- Legacy import-only OAuth file: `~/.openkrab/credentials/oauth.json` (imported into `auth-profiles.json` on first use).

More detail: [/concepts/oauth](/concepts/oauth)

Credential types:

- `type: "api_key"` â†’ `{ provider, key }`
- `type: "oauth"` â†’ `{ provider, access, refresh, expires, email? }` (+ `projectId`/`enterpriseUrl` for some providers)

## Profile IDs

OAuth logins create distinct profiles so multiple accounts can coexist.

- Default: `provider:default` when no email is available.
- OAuth with email: `provider:<email>` (for example `google-antigravity:user@gmail.com`).

Profiles live in `~/.openkrab/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` under `profiles`.

## Rotation order

When a provider has multiple profiles, OpenKrab chooses an order like this:

1. **Explicit config**: `auth.order[provider]` (if set).
2. **Configured profiles**: `auth.profiles` filtered by provider.
3. **Stored profiles**: entries in `auth-profiles.json` for the provider.

If no explicit order is configured, OpenKrab uses a roundâ€‘robin order:

- **Primary key:** profile type (**OAuth before API keys**).
- **Secondary key:** `usageStats.lastUsed` (oldest first, within each type).
- **Cooldown/disabled profiles** are moved to the end, ordered by soonest expiry.

### Session stickiness (cache-friendly)
\nOpenKrab **pins the chosen auth profile per session** to keep provider caches warm.
It does **not** rotate on every request. The pinned profile is reused until:

- the session is reset (`/new` / `/reset`)
- a compaction completes (compaction count increments)
- the profile is in cooldown/disabled

Manual selection via `/model â€¦@<profileId>` sets a **user override** for that session
and is not autoâ€‘rotated until a new session starts.

Autoâ€‘pinned profiles (selected by the session router) are treated as a **preference**:
they are tried first, but OpenKrab may rotate to another profile on rate limits/timeouts.
Userâ€‘pinned profiles stay locked to that profile; if it fails and model fallbacks
are configured, OpenKrab moves to the next model instead of switching profiles.

### Why OAuth can â€œlook lostâ€

If you have both an OAuth profile and an API key profile for the same provider, roundâ€‘robin can switch between them across messages unless pinned. To force a single profile:

- Pin with `auth.order[provider] = ["provider:profileId"]`, or
- Use a per-session override via `/model â€¦` with a profile override (when supported by your UI/chat surface).

## Cooldowns

When a profile fails due to auth/rateâ€‘limit errors (or a timeout that looks
like rate limiting), OpenKrab marks it in cooldown and moves to the next profile.
Format/invalidâ€‘request errors (for example Cloud Code Assist tool call ID
validation failures) are treated as failoverâ€‘worthy and use the same cooldowns.

Cooldowns use exponential backoff:

- 1 minute
- 5 minutes
- 25 minutes
- 1 hour (cap)

State is stored in `auth-profiles.json` under `usageStats`:

```json
{
  "usageStats": {
    "provider:profile": {
      "lastUsed": 1736160000000,
      "cooldownUntil": 1736160600000,
      "errorCount": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Billing disables

Billing/credit failures (for example â€œinsufficient creditsâ€ / â€œcredit balance too lowâ€) are treated as failoverâ€‘worthy, but theyâ€™re usually not transient. Instead of a short cooldown, OpenKrab marks the profile as **disabled** (with a longer backoff) and rotates to the next profile/provider.

State is stored in `auth-profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "usageStats": {
    "provider:profile": {
      "disabledUntil": 1736178000000,
      "disabledReason": "billing"
    }
  }
}
```

Defaults:

- Billing backoff starts at **5 hours**, doubles per billing failure, and caps at **24 hours**.
- Backoff counters reset if the profile hasnâ€™t failed for **24 hours** (configurable).

## Model fallback

If all profiles for a provider fail, OpenKrab moves to the next model in
`agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`. This applies to auth failures, rate limits, and
timeouts that exhausted profile rotation (other errors do not advance fallback).

When a run starts with a model override (hooks or CLI), fallbacks still end at
`agents.defaults.model.primary` after trying any configured fallbacks.
